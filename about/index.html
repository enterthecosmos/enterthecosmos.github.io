<h1>Applying to PhDs is confusing.</h1>

<p>Whether you're a high school student looking ahead or have already graduated
with a Masters degree, the PhD application process is fraught with unspoken
rules and mysterious terminology.</p>

<p>My aim is to even the playing field for underprivileged applicants and those
from "non-conventional" backgrounds by explaining every step in detail. There
are no pre-requisities and no hidden knowledge.</p>

<b>Just application advice, plainand simple.</b>
