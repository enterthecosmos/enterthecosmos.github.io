*Twenty five.*

It's weird being this age. I distinctly remember being 10 years old and thinking about what it'd be like to be 25. I wondered who I'd be. I think I imagined myself a bit more "adult", a bit more grown-up.

In reality, the only real difference between 24 and 25 is that 25 comes with *guilt* for not being more secure in life. I think that's really made an lot worse with the PhD and all â€” it's kinda hard watching my old schoolmates buy houses, get married, have kids, being settled etc all while I'm living off less-than-minimum wage in a sharehouse.

So yeah, twenty five.

It was never going to be a great celebration, I think, but the pandemic and being so far from home definitely makes it worse. I've spent the entirety of today inside and have only spoken to my boyfriend. I wanted to call my family but with the time difference, I can only do that very early in the morning or late at night. We couldn't even legally go for a walk outside with a coffee, or have a picnic outside. These restrictions are wearing us all down.

Adult birthdays aren't really very fun.
