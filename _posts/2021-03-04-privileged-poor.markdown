I was having a discussion recently[^1] over a tweet about first-gen status and the struggles we face compared to our peers with college-educated parents:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am<br>first-gen high school<br>first-gen college<br>first-gen masters<br>first-gen PhD<br>How do I compete with people whose grandparents went to Yale and they are an Ivy family? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/firstgen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#firstgen</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AcademicChatter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AcademicChatter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/phdlife?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#phdlife</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcademicTwitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AcademicTwitter</a></p>&mdash; Hakan DoÄŸa (@HakanDoa) <a href="https://twitter.com/HakanDoa/status/1365816927466250246?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But this got me thinking about a related topic, that of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/17/18647250/privileged-poor-university-admissions-anthony-abraham-jack">"privileged poor"</a>.

The idea is relatively simple: it is not just your family's educational background and socioeconomic status (SES) that give you privilege, so does your education. Or more precisely, you will gain privilege if you are educated alongside the elites, regardless of family educational attainment or SES.

This is seen quite plainly in the US; Anthony Abraham Jack, the author of <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976894">The Privileged Poor</a>, studied a group of elite colleges in the US and found that approximately 50% of the lower income students there had attended the most prestigious, expensive, and rigorous private high schools, also known as "magnet" or "feeder" schools.

We see it at Cambridge as well. Many of the lowest SES students admitted have come from quite solid schools, where they may have been supported by scholarships or other charitable funds. And it works the other way too: there are wealthy students at state-run schools as well. We lack reliable ways to categorise students by advantage or disadvantage. The issue isn't simply black or white, it's innumerable shades of grey.

The concept of the "privilege poor" is currently mostly used in reference to the sort of high school you attend, but I think it can be extended throughout education, all the way up to PhD!

#### Imagine 3 students, all from average or underfunded state high schools, all first-generation for university...

 - Student 1 (James) attends a relatively average local university for undergrad and then another (or the same) relatively average university for Masters/PhD.

 - Student 2 (Tom) attends a similar undergrad institution to James, but then wins a scholarship to attend a prestigious university for his postgraduate degree.

 - Student 3 (Harry) attends a prestigious university for both undergrad and postgrad.

#### And consider the impact this trajectory has on each...

 - James' institution is filled with mostly working class students whose parents did not graduate university. To serve this population, the institution focusses heavily on work readiness, and the support provided by the careers service centres around the workforce. There are few opportunities to do research and no culture to push James towards this option. James doesn't consider postgrad study until very late in his degree and lacks people to ask for advice. During postgrad, he makes fewer connections, partly because he has never learned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_curriculum">hidden curriculum</a>, and partly because his institute is not wealthy, and so does not host many visitors or send students to visit other institutes. James views his path through the lens of meritocracy, and he believes that the only thing which matters is his raw academic achievement. Academia, however, values networking equally as much as raw skill. James does not get an academic job.

 - Tom's undergraduate institution is like James', and does not push him towards academia. But, through whatever stroke of luck or dumb chance, he finds himself on the path to academia early enough to make a strong application to postgrad studies and wins an award to a top institution. On arrival, he lacks knowledge of the hidden curriculum and finds it hard to relate to his much wealthier and much more knowledgeable peers. While they have equal academic skill, Tom knows far less about networking and publishing. He struggles for some time, but with a lot of hard work is able to catch up to some degree. The networking opportunities his university provides gives him a solid leg up in the academic job market, and people are impressed with the name on his CV. He gets multiple postdoctoral offers.

 - Harry's undergraduate university teaches him about academia from day 1. He and his peers are encouraged to join a research group early, and competition is fierce. The careers service offers assistance with both industry resumes <em>and</em> academic CVs. Harry struggles at first but eventually catches up, learning the new lingo and the hidden curriculum over his 3-4 years there. When it comes time to apply to postgrad, he knows exactly how these applications should be structured and has much support from his peers and lecturers. His letter writers are well-respected and renowned experts with ties to many prestigious institutions. When Harry gets into another prestigious institution for his postgrad, he integrates rather seamlessly. They share stories of their early research experiences and trips abroad for conferences. Harry's CV sports prestigious institutions for every degree listed and his accent and manner of speaking matches that of his wealthy peers; he is now effectively indistinguishable from the elite. Harry is awarded the most prestigious postdoctoral fellowship and then goes on to secure a faculty position at a top research university.

#### But what does it mean?

Well, at first glance, each of James, Tom, and Harry have a disadvantaged background. Each one has their own sob story to tell, and it may be that none was clearly more disadvantaged than the other at the high school level. Yet Harry and Tom progress with the elites and eventually become ~indistinguishable from them while James remains an outsider.

The privileged poor, in the original sense of high school status, become privileged because their <em>school</em> and <em>peers</em> teach them the hidden curriculum.

I argue that there's nothing particularly special about high school in this regard, and that you can learn the hidden curriculum and become integrated with the elites at later stages too.

Someone who attends a magnet high school will be ahead of someone who "only" sees prestige once they get to university, but both are more privileged than someone who has neither opportunity.

In the above examples, I see myself mostly in James. My undergraduate institution was rather average and focussed on work readiness, but through random chance I found myself doing research. Eventually, that lead me to get a full cost scholarship to do my PhD at Cambridge. Making that jump has been difficult, but I see the additional benefits I get just by being here. I see the insane wealth of this institution and how it opens doors for its graduates regardless of their background prior. I am privileged by being here, and it is not right that I (and others like Tom and Harry) should get such overwhelming public recognition for our sob stories.

<blockquote>I was disadvantaged up until PhD, but now it is time to set that role aside and accept that I am, at least to some extent, privileged and elite.</blockquote>
