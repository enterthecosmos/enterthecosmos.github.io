It's Monday today, the 1st of March 2021!

That marks 2 days since I got the vaccine and almost a year since the pandemic really got out of hand. It would have been around this time last year that we got the email notifying us that the university was closing, and that we should leave the country.

On the vaccine front, I can't say I had a whole lot of side effects from the first dose. I had a bit of a sore arm, and maybe I was a little more tired than usual, but I also chose not to take my wakefulness-promoting meds (they affect histamine, and I didn't want to mess up my immune response) so that could be the reason for the fatigue.

It does make me a little concerned. I know that the side effects are really just your immune system doing its job and taking the "infection" (the vaccine does not contain a live virus) seriously. If I didn't react, does that mean I have less immunity?

I've also heard that the first dose tends to be worse for people who've had COVID before, though. Many of the people whose stories I'm seeing are from the US, so they probably have a higher chance of already having caught COVID. They don't have any kind of serious lockdowns, whereas in the UK I've been stuck inside for months, and can't go to the office or even inside the supermarket. I don't see other human beings beyond my house, so I'm almost certain I haven't had COVID. And that's not including the ~6 months I spent in Australia, with zero COVID cases in my entire state!

On the 1-year-anniversary-of-the-pandemic front, it's a sad occasion. I wonder how different my PhD could have been without this? I've become very isolated from working from home — I don't attend morning coffee, I frequently skip meetings, I eat lunch alone, I rarely talk to anyone beyond my supervisor, and even that is weekly at best. But I'm also not really suffering from any of this. It's my choice to be so isolated. I enjoy it. I don't really know what that means for me, or if it *should* mean something. Maybe I should be looking into remote work after I graduate?

One thing is for sure: I never really appreciated the little things in life before. Sitting down in a café for a cup of coffee. Having a picnic in the park. Going for a long drive. Gardening. Sitting in the backyard, under the shade of a tree, listening to the birdsong. Having family over for dinner. When the restrictions ease, I won't be rushing to get back into the office but I will rush to do these things again.
