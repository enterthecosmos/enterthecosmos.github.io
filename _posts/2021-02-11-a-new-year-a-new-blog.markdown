So, first post of a new blog!

I should probably start by giving a pseudo-introduction...

I'm a 2nd year (out of 3-4) year PhD student in the UK, doing theoretical and
computational astrophysics research.

Before starting my PhD in 2019, I lived overseas (in my home country) and
attended a much less famous and prestigious university where I did my undergrad.
Moving from that environment to the one I'm now in was a big challenge, not just
from the cultural changes but also from the logistics of moving overseas as a
lone 20-something for the first time!

It was only a few months later that COVID-19 was recognised worldwide and became
a pandemic.

I very quickly left the UK on the urging of my home country and continued (or,
rather, attempted to) my PhD from the other side of the globe. Being separated
from my research group, new friends, and ultimately my life was hard, but I
don't regret going back home. I managed to pass my qualifying/upgrade exam (a
horrible experience I *might* blog about one day) and got some much-needed
sunlight.

I returned to the UK for the start of the new academic year in October 2020,
re-entering a country that still suffers from an unmanaged, widespread outbreak
even today (Feb 2021). I returned to lockdowns and testing and anxiety. But I
also returned to a household of new people, one of whom is now my partner!
Now, we're looking at houses and planning a future together, although there's
still so much we don't know and it's so hard to predict what the world, or our
own interests, will look like in 12 months.

All in all, things are confusing. There have been really bad days, but there
have also been quite a few very good days. Without the pandemic and everything
else, perhaps I would not have met my current partner. Perhaps I would not have
passed my qualifier. I certainly would not have gotten to see my family at home.
To take away the bad bits I'd have to take away the good, too.

Anyway, I've heard it said before that you should write out your thoughts to get
them organised, so that's what I'll be doing here! Hopefully at least some of my
stories will be interesting and very few will be (too) ignorant.

Happy to make your acquaintance, anonymous reader!
