I've never really been much of a people-person.

My mum tells me that on the first day of kindergarten, I simply got out of the car and walked away. She asked me if I'd like her to come in with me, to which I said "No". It must have been a confusing experience — 3 years earlier she'd had to drag my brother, screaming and crying, out of the car.

I never really needed people as others do. I don't mean that in the sense of "I can go longer without contact", but more-so "I desperately need my solitary independence".

I realised today that I've been pathologising this aspect of my personality my entire life. It's always seen as an oddity, something *defective*, something that must *be fixed*. And I believed them — the adults, the counsellors, my peers. They needed (what I saw as) constant contact. I didn't, and so I must be wrong.

Things have been a little rough lately and I've been feeling under extra pressure to work long hours, leaving me little time to decompress alone. I finally got up the courage to tell my partner this, that I needed a bit more space, even entire evenings completely alone. And he said it was perfectly fine and that I shouldn't ever be afraid to take more alone time.

I nearly cried at that! No one has **ever** given me unrestricted permission to be myself, it always came with judgement, jealousy, concern, or guilt. It has only ever been a compromise that others begrudgingly made, always with a strong message of "I'm making a sacrifice for you and you owe me one".

To finally be accepted for who I am is ecstatic. :heart:
