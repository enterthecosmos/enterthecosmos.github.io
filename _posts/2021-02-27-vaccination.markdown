I got the first shot of the vaccine today!

I was worried it might hurt a lot, like the Gardasil and MenACWY vaccines do,
but I really didn't feel a thing for this one. Maybe I'll be more sore and tired
tomorrow, but then again, I'm already sore and tired from walking for 4 hours
yesterday! The Cambridge Botanical Gardens are beautiful but they're also pretty
far away from my college. Not to mention how *huge* the gardens are.

On reflection, it does seem strange how much we've hyped up the side effects
of these vaccines in particular. On the whole, the potential side effects are
the same as they are for most other vaccines - mild tenderness and weakness in
the arm, fatigue, headache. It's hardly big stuff and if it were anything else,
no one would give a damn. If I sleep a bit funny one night and wake up with a
sore neck I might complain briefly, but I'm not going to post to social media
about it or tell everyone all about my symptoms. You could argue that we need
to discuss side effects because people are afraid, and I'll give you that. I
just wonder why they're afraid of this vaccine when they've (generally) had tens
of vaccines over their lifetime, plenty of which they can easily remember...
But I know the answer to that one as well: people are worried about a vaccine
that they perceive to have been "rushed" (my own mum included).

The simple truth comes down to two things: (1) advancements in technology
making it easier to produce known-to-be-safe vaccines, and (2) money. The entire
world has dedicated so much money and collective human hours to this problem!
Governments have cut away the unnecessary delays in the system and have prioritised
the review of this vaccine data as soon as it comes through. There's so much
administrative bloat in our systems but we *can* move it aside when we
really want to. A deadly pandemic is just that sort of motivator.

We didn't produce previous vaccines as quickly because we just didn't want it
badly enough.

*Anyway, I got a bit side-tracked. So, yeah, first-dose!*

Some people might be wondering why I'd get the invitation - I'm 25
years old (young), doing a PhD (so probably not that disadvantaged), wasn't a
member of a shielding group, and appear pretty healthy. I got the vaccine early,
in group 6, because I am diagnosed with a Severe Mental Illness (SMI). I didn't
actually expect to get the invite until ~July like the other 25yo's I know, but
the UK has decided to prioritise those with SMI following a review of the data
on relative population risks. I commend them for doing this, as mental illness
is often overlooked when it comes to non-mental health. People with SMI are at
an increased risk of developing severe COVID and consequently dying. Our life
expectancy is *10-20 years* lower than average. And people with SMI may
be less likely to trust medical professionals and accept the vaccine, so we may
need more discussion and support and dedicated attention in this space.

Prioritising those with SMI is important and good!

I do often wonder whether I'm "disabled enough" or "ill enough" for things,
and this vaccine has been no exception. I thought about calling the surgery to
make sure my invitation wasn't a mistake but I don't see myself as "that ill".

But I *am* "that ill".

A medical professional diagnosed me with SMI at the end of college (Year 12).
That diagnosis has been upheld by multiple professionals in different cities and
countries. I have to trust that they can diagnose me, and I have to trust them
when they say I'm at increased risk. It was my turn. I did the right thing.
