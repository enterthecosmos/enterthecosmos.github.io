It started with a Kalanchoe named Odin. Two months later, he was joined by an Echeveria named Lernaean (Lernie). These two little plants might be worthless to most people, but I've found that taking care of them really helps my mental health. I try hard not to bore my friends with details of plants, so I'm going to write out all of my tips and tricks for succulent care here instead!

*Obvious disclaimer: it only applies to these two plants. There are loads of different kinds of succulent, and they all like slightly different conditions.*

## sunlight

Succulents are pretty hardy plants, but they're sun-lovers! Full shade will not make these beauties happy. Try to give yours full or filtered morning sun where you can, but avoid a harsh afternoon sun - it's often too strong and will burn leaves. Burn damage is permanent (for the leaf) and impacts how well the plant can absorb sunlight in the future. If a plant is very badly burnt, it may die.

I live in the UK with access to two windows:

1. South-facing. Because the UK sun sits slightly in the South all day, this window gets light all day. Good for the morning, but too intense from ~midday onwards.
2. West-facing. Gets afternoon sun but only later in the day, and not as directly.

Surprisingly, I find my succulents do best on the west-facing windowsill!

## water

Ah, watering. A real scourge for succulents. Am I overwatering? Am I underwatering? Here's what I've learnt.

It's far better to underwater than to overwater. An underwatered plant is cured simply by dousing it with water and letting it recover over a day or two. An overwatered plant, however, may have rotting roots that have to be cleaned and pruned and left to dry completely in air, and in the worst cases, there will be nothing you can do to save the plant. So how do you tell the difference?

#### overwatering

- Entire leaves will yellow and/or go translucent

- Leaves seem to droop almost as though they were melting. This is because the leaf is so overfull with water that its cells are bursting. It's turning to mush from the inside out and cannot support its own weight, which has also increased.

- The above seem to affect large sections of the plant, e.g. all of the lower leaves, or a 1/4 section.

- The leaves feel both inflated and soft/squishy

- In extreme cases, the parts of the stem will go soft and may smell bad - this is rotting and will likely spell death for the plant.

#### underwatering

- Leaves become thin, floppy, and wrinkled.

- Leaves may begin to turn yellow and then brown, but will do so from the tip, shrivelling as they go.

- Echeveria don't show wrinkles as easily, so for Lernie, I can tell he's very thirsty by pinching the end of a leaf, as though I were trying to close it along the natural fold. If the leaf can be squished like this then it will show wrinkles - the leaf is underinflated. A well-watered leaf is firm.

- Plant overall becomes less vibrant. Kalanchoe loses its shine and even begins to look a little grey.
