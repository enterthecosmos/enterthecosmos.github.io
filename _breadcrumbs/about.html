<h6><i>Life can be pretty confusing at times.</i></h6>

<p>There are many challenges to face in such a strange and delicate world, but
there is also such great beauty and fun. As I navigate the oft-conflicting
worlds of academia, industry, friendship, love, and loss, I hope that this blog
can document both the highs and lows that each world offers.</p>

<p>I'm a PhD student just blogging about life across seas and through time.
Stick with me till the end and we might just look back on it all â€” maybe then
it'll all make sense.</p>
